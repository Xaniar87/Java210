# Drill 00
For this drill, you should simply load the project into Eclipse, look over the code, 
follow the instructions in the comment at the top of 'Drill00.java' and submit the
file, 'Drill00.java' to Gradescope. 

## Running the files
To run the files provided in Eclipse, there are a few more steps than just clicking the 
green run button for these. Instead of running the Drill00.java file, the Drill00TestClass.java
file is the primary file that will be used with what's called JUnit. 

If Drill00TestClass.java has lots of red squigley lines and syntax errors, you will need 
to add JUnit to the project. Luckily, this is included with Eclipse, so adding JUnit should
be a quick process. 

Right click on the project in the project explorer in Eclipse, and go through the menu
Build Path > Add Libraries. You should then see another new window. 

From here, select JUnit, click next, and in the dropdown menu, select JUnit 5. Click 
Finish, and JUnit will have successfully have been added to your project. 

You can run the TestClass file with JUnit. This can be done by right clicking on 
this file, and going through the menu Run As > JUnit Test. 

This will show you a bit more, such as if all the tests passed, shown by a green bar, 
as well as which tests inside of the test file failed if there are any. 

## Turnin
You will only need to submit Drill00.java to Gradescope.
